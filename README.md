DFetch can manage dependencies

We needed a dependency manager that was flexible enough to retrieve dependencies as plain text
from various sources. `svn externals`, `git submodules` and `git subtrees` solve a similar
problem, but not in a VCS agnostic way or completely user friendly way.
We want self-contained code repositories without any hassle for end-users.
Dfetch must promote upstreaming changes, but allow for local customizations.

Other tools that do similar things are ``Zephyr's West``, ``CMake ExternalProject`` and other meta tools.

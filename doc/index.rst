What is Dfetch?
---------------

Dfetch is source-only no-hassle project-dependency aggregator.

We needed a dependency manager that was flexible enough to retrieve dependencies as plain text
from various sources. `svn externals`, `git submodules` and `git subtrees` solve a similar
problem, but not in a vcs agnostic way or completely user friendly way.
We want self-contained code repositories without any hassle for end-users.
Dfetch must promote upstreaming changes, but allow for local customizations.

Other tools that do similar things are ``Zephyr's West``, ``CMake ExternalProject`` and other meta tools.

Installation
------------
`Dfetch` is a python based cross-platform cli tool.
To install it either install the python package or download the binary and place it in your system PATH.

   dfetch --version

Troubleshooting
===============

Although we do our best, *Dfetch* can always do something unexpected.
A great deal of *Dfetch* functionality is dependent on plain-old command line commands.

First of all, it is important to see what tools the system has.
This can be seen with :ref:`dfetch environment<environment>`.

Each command *Dfetch* performs and its result can be shown with increasing the verbosity
with the `-v` flag. For example, if an :ref:`dfetch import<import>` is giving strange results, re-run it with::

    dfetch -v import

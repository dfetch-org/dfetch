You can report issues by opening a confidential issue via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/dfetch/dfetch/security/advisories). See [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for more info.
If you have no contact please contact us through the mail listed in the pyproject.toml.

We aim to respond to security reports within 5 business days.

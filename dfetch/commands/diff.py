"""*Dfetch* can create a patch file with your local changes to the external project.

If you've found any issues with the remote project, you can fix these issues inside the
context of your project. To help the upstream project, you can generate a patch file
that can be applied by the upstream maintainer. The patch will be generated with the
version control system of your main project that contains the manifest.

To generate a patch, *Dfetch* requires two revisions to determine the changes. You can
provide these through the ``--revs`` argument.

* If ``--revs`` is not provided the changes are calculated between the last revision
  the metadata file was changed and the working copy (also uncommitted changes).
* If ``--revs`` specifies one revision (e.g. ``--revs 23864ef2``), that revision will be used as starting point.
* Alternately both revisions can be explicitly specified, e.g. ``--revs 23864ef2:4a9cb18``.

The below statement will generate a patch for ``some-project`` from your manifest.

.. code-block:: sh

   dfetch diff some-project


Using the generated patch
=========================
The patch can be used in the manifest see the :ref:`patch` attribute for more information.
It can also be sent to the upstream maintainer in case of bug fixes.

The patch generated is a relative patch and should be applied specifying the base directory of the *git repo*.
See below for the version control specifics. The patch will also contain content of binary files.

.. code-block:: sh

   # For git repo's
   git apply --verbose --directory='some-project' some-project.patch

   # For svn repo's
   svn patch some-project.patch

.. warning::

   The path given to ``--directory`` when applying the patch in a git repo, *must* be relative to the base
   directory of the repo, i.e. the folder where the ``.git`` folder is located.

   For example if you have the patch ``Core/MyModule/MySubmodule.patch``
   for files in the directory ``Core/MyModule/MySubmodule/`` and your current working directory is ``Core/MyModule/``.
   The correct command would be:

   ``git apply --verbose --directory='Core/MyModule/MySubModule` MySubmodule.patch``

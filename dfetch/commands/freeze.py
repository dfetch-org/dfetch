"""*Dfetch* can freeze the current versions of the projects.

Say you have the following manifest:

.. code-block:: yaml

    manifest:
        version: 0.0

        projects:
         - name: mymodule
           url: http://git.mycompany.local/mycompany/mymodule


As explained in :ref:`Revision/Branch/Tag` when no version is provided the latest
version of the default branch (e.g. `trunk`, `master`) of ``mymodule`` will
be fetched on a *DFetch* update_.
When your project becomes stable and you want to rely on a specific version
of ``mymodule`` you can run ``dfetch freeze``.

First *DFetch* will rename your old manifest (appended with ``.backup``).
After that a new manifest is generated with all the projects as in your original
manifest, but each with the specific version as it currently is on disk.

In our above example this would for instance result in:

.. code-block:: yaml

    manifest:
        version: 0.0

        projects:
         - name: mymodule
           url: http://git.mycompany.local/mycompany/mymodule
           tag: v1.0.0

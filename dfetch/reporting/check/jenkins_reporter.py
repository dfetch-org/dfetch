"""*Dfetch* can generate a report that is parseable by Jenkins from the :ref:`check` results.

Dependending on the state of the projects it will create a report with information.
If all project are up-to-date, nothing will be added to the report.

The information has several severities:

* ``high`` : An unfetched project. Fetch the project to solve the issue.
* ``normal`` : An out-of-date project. The project is not pinned and a newer version is available.
* ``low`` : An pinned but out-of-date project. The project is pinned to a specific version,
            but a newer version is available.

The report generated is the `native json format`_ of the `warnings-ng plugin`_. The plugin will
show an overview of the found issues:

.. image:: images/out-of-date-jenkins2.png
    :alt: Cpputest is out-of-date and requires updating.

When an issues is clicked, you can see the exact location in the manifest where the project is listed.

.. image:: images/out-of-date-jenkins.png
    :alt: Cpputest is out-of-date and requires updating.

Usage
-----

Add to pipeline using `warnings-ng plugin`_:

.. code-block:: groovy

    /* For a windows agent */
    bat: 'dfetch check --jenkins-json jenkins.json'

    /* For a linux agent */
    sh: 'dfetch check --jenkins-json jenkins.json'

    recordIssues tool: issues(pattern: 'jenkins.json', name: 'DFetch')

With the `warnings-ng plugin`_ quality gates thresholds can be set to influence the build result.
For example don't fail when pinned projects are out-of-date.For more information see the
`quality gate configuration`_ documentation of the `warnings-ng plugin`_.

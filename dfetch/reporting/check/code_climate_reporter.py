"""*Dfetch* can generate a report that is parseable by Gitlab/Code-climate from the :ref:`check` results.

Dependending on the state of the projects it will create a report with information.
If all project are up-to-date, nothing will be added to the report.

The information has several severities:

* ``major`` : An unfetched project. Fetch the project to solve the issue.
* ``minor`` : An out-of-date project. The project is not pinned and a newer version is available.
* ``info`` : An pinned but out-of-date project. The project is pinned to a specific version,
            but a newer version is available.

The report generated is the `code-climate json format`_, the fields described in the
`gitlab custom code quality tool`_ documentation are in the report but also all fields
listed as required by the `code-climate json format`_.

Gitlab will show the results with the pipeline

.. image:: images/gitlab-check-pipeline-result.png
    :alt: Gitlab detected issues.

And clicking will bring you to the project in the manifest.

.. image:: images/gitlab-highlighted-manifest.png
    :alt: Gitlab highlights the project in the manifest with the issue.

In the merge request, gitlab will compare the issues in the current branch with that of
the base branch (e.g. `master`/`main`). This lets you see if any new issue were introduced
or solved.

Usage
-----
Let *DFetch* perform a check and generate the code-climate json and add the result as artifact in you gitlab-ci runner.
See `gitlab code quality reports`_ for more information.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dfetch:
      image: "python:3.7"
      script:
      - pip install dfetch
      - dfetch check --code-climate dfetch.json
      artifacts:
        reports:
          codequality: dfetch.json
